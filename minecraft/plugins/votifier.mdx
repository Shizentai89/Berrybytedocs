[NuVotifier](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nuvotifier.13449/) is a Bukkit plugin which can be used to integrate the **voting functionality** to your Minecraft server and have your server **appear on voting sites**. This plugin is a fork of the original outdated voting plugin: **Votifier**. NuVotifier offers robust code, compatible with the latest Minecraft updates, and vote forwarding.

The plugin can also be **installed on proxies** like BungeeCord, Waterfall, Velocity, and others to be able to forward votes to other servers on the network. The plugin is also **backwards-compatible** with Minecraft versions so all versions from 1.7.2 to the latest version (1.19.2 at the time of writing) is supported. Neat, right?

You can use voting sites to **boost the rank on the server lists** to have your server appear higher, and **give players rewards** when they vote.
This guide will walk you through installation and usage of NuVotifier (Votifier) on your Minecraft server as well as configuring rewards!

## Installation

To install and configure NuVotifier on your Minecraft server, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of NuVotifier from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nuvotifier.13449/).
2. Place the downloaded JAR file in the `plugins`/`mods` (depends on your server software; `plugins` for Bukkit-based servers, `mods` for Forge and Fabric) folder of your Minecraft server. Refer to [this guide](../../lime/importing-files) for help.
3. Restart the server. The plugin will automatically be installed and activated.
4. When the server has fully started, stop the server.
