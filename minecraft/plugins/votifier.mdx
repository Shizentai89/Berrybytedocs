[Votifier](https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap) is a Bukkit plugin (or a mod), which can be used to integrate the voting functionality to your Minecraft server and have your server appear on voting sites.

You can use voting sites to boost the rank on the server lists to have your server appear higher.
This guide will walk you through installation and usage of Dynmap on your Minecraft server!

## Installation

To install and configure Votifier on your Minecraft server, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of Votifier from [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/dynmap%C2%AE.274/).
2. Place the downloaded JAR file in the `plugins`/`mods` (depends on your server software; `plugins` for Bukkit-based servers, `mods` for Forge and Fabric) folder of your Minecraft server. Refer to [this guide](../../lime/importing-files) for help.
3. Restart the server. The plugin will automatically be installed and activated.
4. When the server has fully started, stop the server.
