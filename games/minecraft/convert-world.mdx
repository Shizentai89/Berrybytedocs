Once done, you can enjoy your newly converted Minecraft world! If you converted a Java world to Bedrock, open the `mcworld` file to access it. If you've converted a Bedrock world to Java, copy the folder into your saves folder or [upload the folder](../../lime/importing-files/) to your [Minecraft server](https://berrybyte.net/minecraft) to play on it.
