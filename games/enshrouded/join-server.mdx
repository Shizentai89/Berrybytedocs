Enshrouded servers allow you and your friends have to survive, craft, and fight combat in a voxel-based open world RPG game fending off the beasts & journeying across the mountains and deserts.

To experience all of that, you'll need to know how to connect and join your Enshrouded server.

## Finding the IP address

Before you can join and connect to your [Enshrouded server](https://berrybyte.net/enshrouded), you'll need to find the [IP address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address) (a combination of numbers, e.g `104.167.215.1`).

1. Login to the [game control panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. Locate the subdomain or IP:port below the name of the server **(Note: for Enshrouded there is a difference between the gameport and the queryport. You might need to add +1 for the correct port )**
