## Customising Palworld Server Settings

1. Login to the [game panel](https://game.berrybyte.net)
2. **Stop** the server
3. Open the "**DefaultPalWorldSettings.ini**" file and copy its contents
4. Navigate to **Pal** -> **Saved** -> **Config** -> **LinuxServer** -> "**PalWorldSettings.ini**"
5. Paste the contents from the default file into this empty file
6. Remove the first three lines (the comments) - file shouldn't longer than 2 lines
7. Make your changes, and start the server!

<Warning>Make sure your server is stopped before making changes, otherwise it may become cleared!</Warning>
