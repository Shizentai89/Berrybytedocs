This site contains useful guides & tips on how to run various types of game
servers (including Minecraft, Rust and more to come), as well as running VPSes.

This guide is built for BerryByte users, however the same guides can be applied
in other environments.

<Warning>
  This documentation is a work-in-progress. There may be errors or typos in the
  guides, however we're constantly working to improve them. Suggest edits at the bottom of the guide!
